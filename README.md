# c-web-server

This is a simple web server that can be compiled on most systems that include `gcc` and `make`.  The code uses the [AISL](https://github.com/lowenware/aisl) library and follows the steps outlined in the YouTube video "[Web Development in C: Get Started](https://youtu.be/fBi1K2y5kEM)".  It has been tested on Windows using Cygwin.
